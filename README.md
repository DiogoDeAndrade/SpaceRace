# SPEED

Developed for the Game Creator's Club at Lusofona University.
This month, the theme is "Speed". 

## Game

In this game, players will have to be doing maintenance on a starship during a race, ensuring that the ship arrives to the finishing line, as fast as possible.

Environemtn work, a lot of the systems in place

- Tileset spaceship
  - ~~Wall~~
  - ~~Window~~
- Meters: ~~oxygen, destination, speed~~
  - Reach destination = finish race (time matters in tournament mode)
  - ~~Oxygen reaches zero = everybody dies~~
- Event system
  - ~~All events grant points to player that does task~~
  - ~~Fire on board: needs extinguisher, consumes oxygen~~
  - ~~Hull breach: needs fixing (blowtorch), consumes oxygen, pulls players towards it~~
  - ~~Alien: can kill players~~
    - LaserGun
  - ~~Blackout: turns lights off,  need to go to the master switch and reset~~
  - ~~Fuel: need to add fuel to the ship, so that it can speed up~~
    - ~~Fuel is unstable, can blow up~~
  - ~~Nitro: need to produce nitro at a station, and then feed it to the engine, for extra boost~~
    - ~~Nitro is produced by adding fuel to it - 2 fuel = 1 nitro, but we have to hurry up, it eventually explodes~~
  - ~~Fuel and nitro can provoke hull breach when they explode~~
  - Computers acting up: need to fix (wrench/hammer) or it spreads and eventually the ship explodes, reduces integrity over time
    - Short circuit effect
  - If player dies, the other can revive him with the defribilator
  - Adjust events with part of the race (solar flares = more fires, asteroids = more hull breaches)
- Game modes
  - Single player - Just get to destination
  - Multiplayer - Get to the destination, be the best crewman
  - Tournament - Get to the destination, as fast as possible, set names to players
