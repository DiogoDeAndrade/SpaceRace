# SPEED

Developed for the Game Creator's Club at Lusofona University.
This month, the theme is "Speed". 

## Game

In this game, players will have to be doing maintenance on a starship during a race, ensuring that the ship arrives to the finishing line, as fast as possible.

## Todo

- New input system support
- Tileset spaceship
- Meters: oxygen, destination, speed
  - Reach destination = finish race (time matters in tournament mode)
  - Oxygen reaches zero = everybody dies
- Event system
  - All events grant points to player that does task
  - Fire on board: needs extinguisher, consumes oxygen
  - Hull breach: needs fixing (sealant), consumes oxygen, reduces integrity over time, pulls players towards it
  - Alien: can kill players
  - Blackout: turns lights on, need to go to the master switch and reset
  - Fuel: need to add fuel to the ship, so that it can speed up
  - Nitro: need to produce nitro at a station, and then feed it to the engine, for extra boost
  - Short circuit: need to fix (wrench) or it spreads and eventually the ship explodes, reduces integrity over time
  - Predator: can kill players if they pose a threat (if they have torch, wrench or hammer), is invisible
  - Computers acting up: need to fix (hammer) or it spreads and eventually the ship explodes, reduces integrity over time
- Game modes
  - Single player - Just get to destination
  - Multiplayer - Get to the destination, be the best crewman
  - Tournament - Get to the destination, as fast as possible, set names to players
