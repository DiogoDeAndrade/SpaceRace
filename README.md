Oxygen, two players, extinguisher

- Tileset spaceship
  - ~~Wall~~
  - ~~Window~~
- Meters: ~~oxygen~~, destination, speed
  - Reach destination = finish race (time matters in tournament mode)
  - ~~Oxygen reaches zero = everybody dies~~
- Event system
  - ~~All events grant points to player that does task~~
  - ~~Fire on board: needs extinguisher, consumes oxygen~~
  - ~~Hull breach: needs fixing (blowtorch), consumes oxygen, pulls players towards it~~
  - Alien: can kill players
  - ~~Blackout: turns lights off,  need to go to the master switch and reset~~
  - Computers acting up: need to fix (hammer) or it spreads and eventually the ship explodes, reduces integrity over time
  - Fuel: need to add fuel to the ship, so that it can speed up
  - Nitro: need to produce nitro at a station, and then feed it to the engine, for extra boost
  - Short circuit: need to fix (wrench) or it spreads and eventually the ship explodes, reduces integrity over time
  - Predator: can kill players if they pose a threat (if they have torch, wrench or hammer), is invisible
  - If player dies, the other can revive him with the defribilator
- Game modes
  - Single player - Just get to destination
  - Multiplayer - Get to the destination, be the best crewman
  - Tournament - Get to the destination, as fast as possible, set names to players
